# Tapable

The tapable package expose many Hook classes, which can be used to create hooks for plugins.

``` javascript
const {
	SyncHook,
	SyncBailHook,
	SyncWaterfallHook,
	SyncLoopHook,
	AsyncParallelHook,
	AsyncParallelBailHook,
	AsyncSeriesHook,
	AsyncSeriesBailHook,
	AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook
 } = require("tapable");
```

## Installation

``` shell
npm install --save tapable
```

## Usage

All Hook constructors take one optional argument, which is a list of argument names as strings.

``` js
const hook = new SyncHook(["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]);
```

The best practice is to expose all hooks of a class in a `hooks` property:

``` js
class Car {
	constructor() {
		this.hooks = {
			accelerate: new SyncHook(["newSpeed"]),
			brake: new SyncHook(),
			calculateRoutes: new AsyncParallelHook(["source", "target", "routesList"])
		};
	}

	/* ... */
}
```

Other people can now use these hooks:

``` js
const myCar = new Car();

// Use the tap method to add a consument
myCar.hooks.brake.tap("WarningLampPlugin", () => warningLamp.on());
```

It's required to pass a name to identify the plugin/reason.

You may receive arguments:

``` js
myCar.hooks.accelerate.tap("LoggerPlugin", newSpeed => console.log(`Accelerating to ${newSpeed}`));
```

For sync hooks, `tap` is the only valid method t
