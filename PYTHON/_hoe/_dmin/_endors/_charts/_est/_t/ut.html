avaScript engines don't self-host\n\t// `Array.prototype.sort`. This makes sense because C++ will likely remain\n\t// faster than JS when doing raw CPU-intensive sorting. However, when using a\n\t// custom comparator function, calling back and forth between the VM's C++ and\n\t// JIT'd JS is rather slow *and* loses JIT type information, resulting in\n\t// worse generated code for the comparator function than would be optimal. In\n\t// fact, when sorting with a comparator, these costs outweigh the b
