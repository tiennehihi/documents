#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])

Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.
Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the
supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings
is the minimum of this map and the supplied map.

* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.

* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.
  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.
  Otherwise an error will be thrown.

* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap
  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.

  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same
  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source
  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten
  relative to the SourceMap.

  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,
  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()

Renders the source map being generated to a string.

```js
generator.toString()
// '{"version":3,"sources":["module-one.scm"],"names":[],"mappings":"...snip...","file":"my-generated-javascript-file.js","sourceRoot":"http://example.com/app/js/"}'
```

### SourceNode

SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating
snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and
column information associated between those snippets and the original source
code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might
use before outputting the generated JS and source map.

#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])

* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if
  it isn't associated with an original line.  The
