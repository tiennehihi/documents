	   *   - if compression is not successful for the first block, all input
	   *     data is still in the window so we can still emit a stored block even
	   *     when input comes from standard input.  (This can also be done for
	   *     all blocks if lit_bufsize is not greater than 32K.)
	   *   - if compression is not successful for a file smaller than 64K, we can
	   *     even emit a stored file instead of a stored block (saving 5 bytes).
	   *     This is applicable only for zip (not gzip or zlib).
