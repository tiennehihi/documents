array\|string` | `undefined` | One or more glob patterns for excluding strings that should not be matched from the result. |
| `keepQuotes`          | `boolean`      | `false`     | Retain quotes in the generated regex, since quotes may also be used as an alternative to backslashes.  |
| `literalBrackets`     | `boolean`      | `undefined` | When `true`, brackets in the glob pattern will be escaped so that only literal brackets will be matched. |
| `lookbehinds`         | `boolean`      | `true`      | Support regex positive and negative lookbehinds. Note that you must be using Node 8.1.10 or higher to enable regex lookbehinds. |
| `matchBase`           | `boolean`      | `false`     | Alias for `basename` |
| `maxLength`           | `boolean`      | `65536`     | Limit the max length of the input string. An error is thrown if the input string is longer than this value. |
| `nobrace`             | `boolean`      | `false`     | Disable brace matching, so that `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` would be treated as literal characters. |
| `nobracket`           | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Disable matching with regex brackets. |
| `nocase`              | `boolean`      | `false`     | Perform case-insensitive matching. Equivalent to the regex `i` flag. Note that this option is ignored when the `flags` option is defined. |
| `nodupes`             | `boolean`      | `true`      | Deprecated, use `nounique` instead. This option will be removed in a future major release. By default duplicates are removed. Disable uniquification by setting this option to false. |
| `noext`               | `boolean`      | `false`     | Alias for `noextglob` |
