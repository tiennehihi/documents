/**
 * Function that returns two types of paths, one relative to symlink, and one
 * relative to the current working directory. Checks if path is absolute or
 * relative. If the path is relative, this function checks if the path is
 * relative to symlink or relative to current working directory. This is an
 * initiative to find a smarter `srcpath` to supply when building symlinks.
 * This allows you to determine which path to use out of one of three possible
 * types of source paths.
