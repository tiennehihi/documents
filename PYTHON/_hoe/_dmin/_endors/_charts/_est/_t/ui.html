avaScript engines don't self-host\n\t// `Array.prototype.sort`. This makes sense because C++ will likely remain\n\t// faster than JS when doing raw CPU-intensive sorting. However, when using a\n\t// custom comparator function, calling back and forth between the VM's C++ and\n\t// JIT'd JS is rather slow *and* loses JIT type information, resulting in\n\t// worse generated code for the comparator function than would be optimal. In\n\t// fact, when sorting with a comparator, these costs outweigh the benefits of\n\t// sorting in C++. By using our own JS-implemented Quick Sort (below), we get\n\t// a ~3500ms mean speed-up in `bench/bench.html`.\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Swap the elements indexed by `x` and `y` in the array `ary`.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Array} ary\n\t *        The array.\n\t * @param {Number} x\n\t *        The index of the first item.\n\t * @param {Number} y\n\t *        The index of the second item.\n\t */\n\tfunction swap(ary, x, y) {\n\t  var temp = ary[x];\n\t  ary[x] = ary[y];\n\t  ary[y] = temp;\n\t}\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Returns a random integer within the range `
