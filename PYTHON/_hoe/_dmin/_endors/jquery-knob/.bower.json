Node.js: fs-extra
=================

`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It also uses [`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to prevent `EMFILE` errors. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.
