ects with `new Ajv.ValidationError(errors)` if you want to return custom errors from the keyword function).

Ajv compiles asynchronous schemas to [es7 async functions](http://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/) that can optionally be transpiled with [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent).
