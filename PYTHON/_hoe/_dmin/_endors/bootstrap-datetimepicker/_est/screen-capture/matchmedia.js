 Update the window with the last wsize (normally 32K) bytes written before

 when a window is already in use, or when output has been written during this
 inflate call, but the end of the deflate stream has not been reached yet.
 It is also called to create a window for dictionary data when a dictionary
 is loaded.

 Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
 advantage, since only the last 32K of output i
