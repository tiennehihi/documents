 * The only algorithm currently supported for PKI is RSA.
 *
 * An RSA key is often stored in ASN.1 DER format. The SubjectPublicKeyInfo
 * ASN.1 structure is composed of an algorithm of type AlgorithmIdentifier
 * and a subjectPublicKey of type bit string.
 *
 * The AlgorithmIdentifier contains an Object Identifier (OID) and parameters
 * for the algorithm, if any. In the case
