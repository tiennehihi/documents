 * the match callback can be invoked outside of a fetch event, matching logic
 * should not assume the `event` object will always be available.
 * If the match callback returns a truthy value, the matching route's
 * `RouteHandlerCallback` will be invoked immediately. If the value returned
 * is a non-empty array or object, that value will be set on the handler's
 * `options.params` argument.
