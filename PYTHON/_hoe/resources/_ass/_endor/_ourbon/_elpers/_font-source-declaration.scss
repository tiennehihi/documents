# import/extensions

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Some file resolve algorithms allow you to omit the file extension within the import source path. For example the `node` resolver (which does not yet support ESM/`import`) can resolve `./foo/bar` to the absolute path `/User/someone/foo/bar.js` because the `.js` extension is resolved automatically by default in CJS. Depending on the resolver you can configure more extensions to get resolved automatically.

In order to provide a consistent use of file extensions across your code base, this rule can enforce or disallow the use of certain file extensions.

## Rule Details

This rule either takes one string option, one object option, or a string and an object option. If it is the string `"never"` (the default value), then the rule forbids the use for any extension. If it is the string `"always"`, then the rule enforces the use of extensions for all import statements. If it is the string `"ignorePackages"`, then the rule enforces the use of extensions for all import statements except package imports.
