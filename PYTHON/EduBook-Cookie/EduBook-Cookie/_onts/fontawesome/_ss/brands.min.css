# import/group-exports

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Reports when named exports are not grouped together in a single `export` declaration or when multiple assignments to CommonJS `module.exports` or `exports` object are present in a single file.

**Rationale:** An `export` declaration or `module.exports` assignment can appear anywhere in the code. By requiring a single export declaration all your exports will remain at one place, making it easier to see what exports a module provides.

## Rule Details

This rule warns whenever a single file contains multiple named export declarations or multiple assignments to `module.exports` (or `exports`).
