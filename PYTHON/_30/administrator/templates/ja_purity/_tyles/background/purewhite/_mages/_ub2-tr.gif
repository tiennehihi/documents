# combined-stream

A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.

**NB** Currently `combined-stream` works with streams version 1 only. There is ongoing effort to switch this library to streams version 2. Any help is welcome. :) Meanwhile you can explore other libraries that provide streams2 support with more or less compatibility with `combined-stream`.

- [combined-stream2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/combined-stream2): A drop-in streams2-compatible replacement for the combined-stream module.

- [multistream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multistream): A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install combined-stream
```

two files into one:
