This package provides a thin layer on top of [iconv-lite](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite) which makes it expose some of the same primitives as the [Encoding Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/).

```js
const whatwgEncoding = require("whatwg-encoding");

console.assert(whatwgEncoding.labelToName("latin1") === "windows-1252");

console.assert(whatwgEncoding.isSupported("x-mac-cyrillic") === false);

console.assert(whatwgEncoding.getBOMEncoding(new Buffer
