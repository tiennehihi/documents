     * This method calculates the configuration for a given file, which can be useful for debugging purposes.
     * - It resolves and merges extends and overrides settings into the top level configuration.
     * - It resolves the parser setting to absolute paths.
     * - It normalizes the plugins setting to align short names. (e.g., eslint-plugin-foo â†’ foo)

     * - It doesn't interpret the env setting to the globals and parserOptions settings, so the result object contains
     *   the env setting as is.
     * @param filePath The path to the file whose configuration you would like to calculate. Directory paths are forbidden

     * @returns The promise that will be fulfilled wi
